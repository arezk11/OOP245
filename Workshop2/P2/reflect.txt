In this workshop I learned how to allocate and free up memory in my program 
instead of reserving memory space. This dynamic memory allocation lets me 
use memory more efficiently and only when necessary I also learned how to deal with file operations 
like opening and closing files and reading data from them and performing actions on the data
this knowledge helps me work with external files such as reading information from a file or storing data in a file
by understanding these concepts I can manage memory effectively and allocating it when needed and freeing it when its no longer needed
I also I can manipulate files to retrieve or store data for my program
this new skills I had experienced enhances my adaptabiliy and capability as a new C++ programmer using object orinted programing like 
polymorphism that allows me to define multiple forms of a function and code flexibility.
