when i was doing this workshop i learned many things such as modular programing and working with null terminated strings.modular programming made me learn the importantce of breaking the program in smaller piece to manage and to focus on a specific task one at a time and making the code maintanable by implementing the diffrent functions like comparing strings finding substrings and more i applied modular programming to improve my code structure and to organize it , i also worked with null terminated strings these strings are charachters arrays with the special character at the end : '\0' i learned how to find string lenght , concatenate strings and to preform other operations this made me handle diffrent string tasks. i enjoied doing this workshop because i learned a lot from it
