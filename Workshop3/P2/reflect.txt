In this workshop I learned more about encapsulation, which is a way to organize data and operations within a class.
Encapsulation helped me in hiding the inner workings of a class from its clients.by making certain variables and
functions private like m_noOfFoods, m_foodsAdded, totalCal, title, footer, and setEmpty, I was able to limit their access from outside the class.

In the public section of the class, I created functions like init, add, and display. These functions allows interactio
with the objects and perform specific operations with the clients. For example, the add function enables the clients
to add food items. These public functions provide a way for clients to interact with the objects without changing the private members of the class.

I faced some problems in my init function in part 1 my logic was somehow wrong but with the help of my professor 
I got to fix the logic and make it work as expected. but, on matrix the error was a bit diffrent and lead to hours 
and hours of finding the error.which was about iterate up to noOfItems not m_noOfItems.
