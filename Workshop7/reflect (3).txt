In this workshop I learned about inheritance and applied it to complete this workshop.
Inheritance allowed me to create a class hierarchy where Truck class is inheriting from the MotorVehicle class
by using inheritance I was able to use the existing functionsalty of the MotorVehicle class in the truck class 
this saved me time and I didnt write littel code to achive the workshop goal.
in the truck class I added a private member variable called m_capacity and m_cargo to reperesnt the cargo capacity and the current cargo load of the trucks.
and then implemented the member fucntions addcargo and unloadcargo specified to the Truck class , these functions worked on the m_capcity and m_cargo to provide the functionality in handleing the cargo.
Inheritance is a useful feature in oop which helps us in writing less code and to resuse the same code as well as gaining access to member functions in the base class.
