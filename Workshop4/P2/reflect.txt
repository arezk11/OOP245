In this workshop,I learned more and got full understanding of how constroctors and destructors work
because it took too long to find my errors which made me go back to the course notes and some other websites to
read and understand more.constructors are important because they help in initializing objects and set them up properly they also define the properties of the object and get things ready.while destructors on the other hand, are responsible for releasing resources when objects are no longer needed and when they get out of scoop by using them i made sure that the memory is cleaned up and nothing is left inside.

I realized how important constructors and destructors are because the help prevent memory leaks and keep my code 
efficient 

Throughout the workshop I gained a deeper understanding of class design , how to manage the memory and also the importance of modular code.

One of the errors that i faced was on matrix that prevented me from submitting on time was the same error I faced 
before which says:conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)
but this time it was really hard for me to get to the code to catch this error and fix it but after some time i was able to find what was causeing this issue and it was that i need to add an if statement in the setFrame() function to make sure that the frameArg is not nullptr before allocating memory and copying the string.
